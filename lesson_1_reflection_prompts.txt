How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

We can use diff and then check the two file to get answer.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

we can have a logic to save the commit and then we can efficient to use that.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

like the teacher say, if we use the automatically, we will have many many different version , and if we want find some version to check , we will very difficult.
but the good thing is , if we uncareful no save and close the documentation . we can find it by the automatically.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
